#  Normally you would have to set spring.jms.pub-sub-domain=false (default) when writing to a queue
#  and true when writing to a topic. However, it appears that camel handles that.
#  note below i write to a VirtualTopic and read from a queue.  This is a hybrid that takes the best
#  of topics and queues.  However if both values were either queue or topic that should work too.  I tested
#  with queue only and it worked, but didn't test topic.
#  Note both the necessary topic and queue are automatically created.
