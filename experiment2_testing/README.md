* To run the program:  mvn spring-boot:run
* Note this app includes Hawt IO: http://localhost:8080/actuator/hawtio/
* Hawt IO has a Camel tab that has lots of useful information.  In particular the live route diagram is great for visualizing 
your routes and seeing how much data is passing through and whether or not errors are happening.
* Hawt io gives you a way to see JMX data and operations with http/webapp vs using JConsole.
